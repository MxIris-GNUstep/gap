MandelView.BackModule - a mandelbrot bundle for BackSpace.app

This is the first release of this wonderfull backspace module.
Hopefully it wont crash your computer, but - it will most probably
cause you and/or your computer to become quite inactive while the
program is running. It took hours to debug, because once it ran, I
couldn't bring myself to stop it.  This program uses a quite funky
(don't know what this means) algorithm for drawing and zooming in, so
that it is even fun to watch while the picture is being drawn. It is
good so, because it is also slow, and pictures take quite a long time
to draw.  I tried to do my best to make the program be fast - but alas
! That's all I could do. For this I took some of the core code from
the mandelspawn program for X-windows - for calculating in fixed point
precision. As the program zooms in fixed point arithmetic becomes not
accurate enough, and it switches back to floating point. At that stage
I left a small bug (feature), so that at one level of zoom you can see
the graininess of the fixed-point arithmetic.

To install put the file MandelView.BackModule somewhere where
BackSpace will look for it, as in /LocalLibrary/BackSpaceViews, or in
~/Library/BackSpaceViews, or in /Library/BackSpaceViews

Recompiling using the project builder should be no problem, just make
sure that the directory 'output' doesn't exist before you build for
install. Then  MandelView.BackModule will be created in the directory
output.

Things left to do:
- Make it faster !
- Make the zooming smarter, and let it find nicer places.
- Enable saving of the completed picture.
- Make control over the color scheme better.
- Make it even faster !
- Make it find unused supercomputing resources arround the net and use
them.

If the code looks as if it was written by someone who doesn't quite
know objective-c, then it has a good reason - I don't know objective
C. Please don't send me comments on how dirty this code is !

Please send comments, suggestions or letter saying how much you like
this program to:

The files ms_real.c ms_real.h, and the routine mandelbrot in the file
MandelView.m were taken from mandelspawn 0.7 by Andreas Gustafsson,
gson@niksula.hut.fi. As mandelspawn is uder the GPL, I included his
Copying file.
